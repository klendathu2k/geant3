The GCALOR package contains the original CALOR simulation code
(including the low energy neutron code MICAP ) developed and maintained by
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) and an interface to utilize this
code in the framework of GEANT .

GCALOR consists of

HETC
The High-Energy-Transport-Code is transporting charged hadrons up to an
energy of 10 GeV through the materials of the setup
FLUKA
The FLUKA fragmentation model is utilized for interactions above the HETC limit
MICAP
The neutron code from the Monte-carlo-Ionization-Chamber-Analysis-Program is
called for neutrons with a kinetic energy below 20 MeV. The simulation of
interactions is based on measured/calculated cross sections and secondary
particle energy/angular distributions

Interface
---------
The interface between CALOR and GEANT determines which code to call for the
current particle. The material description is automatically extracted from
GEANT The transport of electromagnetic interacting particles is performed by
GEANT as well as the tracking and the calculation of the energy deposition.

Installation with VMC:
------------
 1. Configure Geant3 with the CMake build option -DBUILD_GCALOR=ON

Usage with vmc
--------------
 1. one has to call TGeant3::SetHADR(5) in the initalization of Geant3.
 2. $G3SYS variable has to defined

For the initialisation, GCALOR needs the following  additional cross-section
data (expected files: chetc.dat and xsneut.dat in the $G3SYS/data directory)
for all needed materials, GCALOR Calculate the macroscopic cross-section for
low energy neutrons and write relevant informations for the user to file
calor.out

The GCALOR package has been tested on different computer platforms:

Unix systems
DecAlpha, Silicon Graphics, Hewlett Packard, IBM-R6000, SUN Sparc and Linux on PC
DecVMS
DecALpha and VAX
MVS
IBM Mainframe 3090
