    Allow non-standard-conform BOZ literal constants -fallow-invalid-boz
  - Applied changes to be able to properly use geane
  - Fixed implementation of TGeant3TGeo::VolId
    (thanks to Dennis Klein, GSI for the problem report)
  - Add gcalor:

    - Its build, disabled by default, can be enabled via -DBUILD_GCALOR=ON
    - Fixed compiler warnings:
      - Increased string sizes to support long installation prefixes
      - Set extra compiler flags only if gcalor is build
    - Updated documentation (README_gcalor)
    See README_gcalor for the credits for this code.

    Thanks to Mohammad Al-Turany, Dennis Klein, Dmytro Kresanand Florian Uhlig, GSI
    for the updates in this version.

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p3 and Root 6.22/00.

24/07/2020:
  v3-6:
  - Fixed multiple engine mode:
    In multiple engine mode, the info whether a track is primary or not is
    taken from TMCParticleStatus and passed to gtreveroot.F,
    while in single run the original G3 logic for indexing and transport
    is preserved.
  - ** Note that this fix requires also a fix in VMC (included in 1.0.p3), which is
    not yet present in Root 6.22/00. That's why the multiple engine mode works correctly
    only with VMC stand-alone.

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p3 and Root 6.22/00.

02/07/2020:
  v3-5:
  - Update masses of long lived particles possibly decayed by G3
    (thanks to Ch. Zampolli, CERN)
  - Fix floating point roundoff error in addressing the zebra array
    (thanks to Jason Webb, BNL, STAR Experiment)

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p2 and Root 6.22/00.
  
30/04/2020:
  v3-4:
  -  Restored the dictionaries relocability, improve security and clean up
     for packaging
     Thanks to Christian Tacke, GSI.

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p2 and Root 6.20/04

17/04/2020:
  v3-3:
  - Fixed stacking and G3 internal track indexing.
    Reverted the development in commit e1a8a44 causing a break in ALICE simulation.
    The calls to MCApplication::FinishPrimary() happened too early, before tracking
    of the secondaries of the primary track.
    Thanks to B. Volkel, CERN, Ruprecht Karls Universitaet Heidelberg.
  - ** Note that this fix breaks the multiple engine mode, which will be adapted
    to comply with the VMC stacking logic in the next tag. **

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p1 and Root 6.20/00

31/03/2020:
  v3-2:
  -  Fix for segmentation violation (MacOS 10.15.4)
     Thanks to P. Hristov, CERN.

  Tested with VMC 1.0.p1 and Root 6.20/00

14/03/2020:
  v3-1:
  - Fixed generation of root dictionary map

  Tested with VMC 1.0 and Root 6.20/00

24/02/2020:
  v3-0:
  - Implemented Multiple-engine usage: with this update GEANT3 becomes capable
    of running together with other engines sharing the simulation of one event.
  - Added support for building against VMC stand-alone
  - Updated CMake to make the installation relocatable:
    - Avoid hard-coded library paths in the geant321 target:
      - Added the list of selected libraries which we depend on
        (ROOT_DEPS and VMC_DEPS)
      - Linking the library only against this list instead of
        ${VMC_LIBRARIES}  and ${ROOT_LIBRARIES}
        and added this list in the target interface properties
    - Added target_include_directories
  - Added script and configuration file for clang-format and applied formatting
    to all  .h, .icc, .cxx files in examples, g4root, mtroot, source
  - Take into account new TVirtualMCApplication::EndOfEvent(), called by MC at the end of
    event before SD's end of event

  Tested with VMC 1.0 and Root 6.18/04 (*)

  (*) VMC 1.0 is ahead of the vmc in ROOT 6.18/04,
  it includes fixes scheduled for the next ROOT tags 6.18/06 and 6.20/00.
  For this reason, the new multiple engine mode works correctly only with the
  VMC stand-alone or with vmc in ROOT master or v6-18-patches or v6-20-patches.


22/02/2019:
  v2-7:
  - Fixed stopping a track if called from MCApplication::PreTrack():
    thanks to A. Morsch (CERN)

  Tested with Root 6.14/06

15/01/2019:
  v2-6:
  - Added support for user defined sensitive detectors and new TVirtualMC::NIELEdep() function:
    Details:
    - Implemented new functions in TVirtualMC:
        void SetSensitiveDetector(const TString &volName, TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector *sd);
        TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector *GetSensitiveDetector(const TString &volName) const;
        void SetExclusiveSDScoring(Bool_t exclusiveSDScoring);
        TVirtualMC::NIELEdep() function
  - Fixed a problem with the SAVE statement in miface/gmicap.F (thanks to P. Hristov, CERN)
    this fixes a compilation error observed on centos7 with devtoolset-7-gcc-gfortran
    in ALICE.

  Tested with Root 5.34/38 and 6.14/06

08/09/2017:
  v2-5:
  - Implemented new TVirtualMC functions
      void TrackPosition(Float_t &x, Float_t &y, Float_t &z) const
      void TrackMomentum(Float_t &px, Float_t &py, Float_t &pz, Float_t &etot) const
    Should be available in root/vmc in the next ROOT version.
  - Fix linking with Clang on Linux.
    (Thanks to Florian Uhlig, GSI)
  - Fix in CMake: Do not override CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR.
    (Doing this will cause naming conflict with e.g. the CMake native
    GNUInstallDirs module.)
    (Thanks to Dennis Klein, GSI).

  Tested with Root 5.34/36 and 6.10/04
